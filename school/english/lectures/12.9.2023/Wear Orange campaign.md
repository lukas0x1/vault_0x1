### Background Information : ###


he Wear Orange campaign, initiated in 2015 by Everytown for Gun Safety, is an annual national movement in the United States that raises awareness about gun violence prevention. It takes place each year on National Gun Violence Awareness Day , which is held on the ==first Friday in June==. Supporters across the country participate by wearing orange clothing and accessories as a symbol of their commitment to ending gun violence and commemorating victims like Hadiya Pendleton, tragically lost in 2013.

The campaign has evolved into a significant force, uniting individuals, communities, and organizations in a collective effort to advocate for change. By utilizing the power of the colour orange and the date-specific observance, it continues to draw attention to the urgent need for responsible gun ownership and comprehensive gun safety measures.
